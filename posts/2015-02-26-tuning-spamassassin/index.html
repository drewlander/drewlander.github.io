can be something both fun, and annoying. Hopefully, for any newbies, here are some things
to do that can greatly reduce the amount of spam you receive, as well as minimize

<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>You MUST train both ham and spam to be effective.  I have to use the vscan user, as I run amavis. sa-learn will add the bayesian
tokens to the datbase of the user executing spamassassin.</p>
<p>A nice thing to do is to report mail that you have found to be spam. If you have installed the Razmor moudle, it can be reported to
Vipul's Razor. Assuming in a folder that is full of spam:
{% highlight bash %}
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#66d9ef">for</span> i in <span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>ls<span style="color:#e6db74">`</span>; <span style="color:#66d9ef">do</span> spamassassin -r &lt; $i; <span style="color:#66d9ef">done</span></code></pre></div>
<a href="http://wiki.apache.org/spamassassin/report_spam.pl">This</a> perl script can be run as a cron job. Just point it to a folder that contains only spam.</p>
<p>Ensuring you are doing sa-update frequently, as well as the above, will help spamassassin properly identify spam/ham.
I am personally just tagging the subject, and putting anything with that tag in the subject into a folder that is
just spam, and running the above commands. This, in addition to running postscreen and a few select rbls, has slowed any spam making it
to my inbox to a trickle.</p>
