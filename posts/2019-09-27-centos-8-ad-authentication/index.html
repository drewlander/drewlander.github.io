A huge benefit is the AD authentication we have. It is largely a windows shop where I work, so integrating with AD there
makes the most sense. (We could use FreeIPA but we are trying to KISS).</p>

<p>The first changes was policycoreutils-python is now policycoreutils-python-utils. Seems like a rather redundant name change
but I am sure they had good reasons.</p>

<p>Everything else worked, except that realm join would no longer work. I would get the following error from adcli:
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span style="color:#ae81ff">00002083</span>: AtrErr: DSID-031513D7, <span style="color:#75715e">#2</span></code></pre></div>
The reason was that hostname was not the fqdn. e.x. hostname was foo and it would give the error, but if hostname was foo.domain.local it would join.
Note: I am not talking about the fqdn (hostname -f), I am talking what hostname returns. Unless I missed something in the documentation for realm, I did it not see it.
adcli may have it, and then we could possibly split the join commands into different components, but I just want one command to do the work! Once I set the hostname via
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hostnamectl set-hostname foo.domain.local</code></pre></div>
realm join worked great.</p>

<p>If anyone knows of a fix or what I did wrong, feel free to reach me in #freenode (I am there as drewlander) or #efnet (I am there as drewski).</p>
