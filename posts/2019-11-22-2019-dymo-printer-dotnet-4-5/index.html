I just could not print barcodes for whatever reason. It was ALWAYS blank.<br>
This is out here so if anyone is looking for an answer, here it is.<br>
I googled and googled and the dymo forums are closed and there is NO Google cache for the forums either. I was stuck.<br>
I then changed the project to .NET 3.5 and BAM it printed fine&hellip;. If anyone knows of a way to fix it please let me know at: drewskiwooskie[at]gmail[dot]com.<br>
You cannot just call a .NET 3.5 .dll from a .NET 4.5 program, because it runs it in .NET 4.5, so it still will not print the barcode.<br>
I write a .NET cli app that takes command line parameters which then prints to the printer specified in the cli. I then shell out to it from the .NET 4.5 program.<br>
It works but I feel so dirty.</p>
