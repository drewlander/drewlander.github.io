I am currently dual booting FreeBSD 13.RC5 (13-RELEASE should be out extremely soon as of this post) and Windows 10. I have had no issues.
But can you watch DRM enabled content like Netflix? You bet you can! Download and run https://github.com/mrclksr/linux-browser-installer. Works like a charm. It actually loads faster than native Firefox.
In addition, I have bhyve with an Ubuntu 20.04 guest. I am using the tool vm to manage virtual machines." />

<p>In addition, I have bhyve with an Ubuntu 20.04 guest. I am using the tool vm to manage virtual machines. I will make that another post.</p>
<p>All in all, I can say I am quite pleased. My laptop has the dual graphics, and if I previously did have it using the Nvidia graphics card, but I just have it using the built in Intel graphics and it works great. Most of the games I like are pre-2010 so the card handles it great!</p>
<p>Hardware of note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Wireless 3165</li>
<li>GP107M [GeForce GTX 1050 Mobile]</li>
<li>Intel HD Graphics 630</li>
</ul>
<p>The one regret is that it <a href="https://wiki.freebsd.org/dev/ath(4)">does NOT support</a> my ALFA AR9271. Maybe one day.</p>
